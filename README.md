# to Use:
I am tired with configuring a remote fastapi service, so here is the thing

you may want to ignore the plot folder, since it has no actual use to the webpage, and of course, __pycache__ and .ipynb_checkpoints, which I may uploaded by mistake

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
fastapi run main.py
```

then change the url in the store under the src folder of web

and open the html at https://everythingfades.github.io/arknights_plot/web/dist/index.html

enjoy
